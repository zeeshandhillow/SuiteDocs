You can help translate the SuiteCRM Documentation site to your own language.

First, learn how to link:./../simple-edit/[edit pages].

Then, you simply create a new page with the exact same name as the page you're translating, 
but add your language code before the extension.

So a file named `upgrade.adoc` would become `upgrade.es.adoc` in the Spanish translation.

There is more information about this in the link:../guidelines/[Documentation Guidelines].
